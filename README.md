lenovo-rotate
=============
Small python script to handle rotating screen based on HDD acceleration meter. 
This script needs hdapsd to work. 

Install hdapsd in Ubuntu:
``` sudo apt-get install hdapsd ```

Run: 
``` python rotate.py ```

Rotating works properly in tablet mode. Left and right need to be reversed to work properly in normal mode.

Original work by Michal Nanasi.
